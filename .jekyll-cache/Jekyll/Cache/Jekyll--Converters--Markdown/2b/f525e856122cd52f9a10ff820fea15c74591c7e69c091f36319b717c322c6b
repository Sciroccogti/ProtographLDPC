<p>Linear codes were developed as a means to enable the correction of errors induced in the streaming of data. They are defined by their property that any linear sum of messages results in a message. These codes can be broken into two types - block codes and convolutional codes. This library focuses on code construction as it relates to block codes.</p>

<p>Linear block codes are designed in such a way that upon encoding a message, this message can be decoded assuming a non-critical corruption rate through an analysis of the received message bits. This is accomplished through an evaluation of parity check equations where a modulo summation is performed on the received message indicated by the indices of the parity check equation. For our purposes, the result will be zero.</p>

<p>A code is defined by a collection of these parity check equations, and the number of conforming codewords that can possibly be created is referred to as the size of the code.</p>

<p>linear codes background  - parity check and generator matrices, puncturing, include any additional details as needed.</p>
