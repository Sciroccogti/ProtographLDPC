I"­<p>Linear codes were developed as a means to enable the correction of errors induced in the streaming of data. They are defined by their property that any linear sum of messages results in a message. These codes can be broken into two types - block codes and convolutional codes. This library focuses on code construction as it relates to block codes.</p>

<p>Linear block codes are designed in such a way that, upon encoding a message, this message can be decoded assuming a non-critical corruption rate through an analysis of the received message bits.</p>

<p>linear codes background  - parity check and generator matrices, puncturing, include any additional details as needed.</p>
